    <h2>Built by Hustle. Driven by Strength.</h2>
    <p>Just The Muscle was founded with a simple mission: provide reliable, professional labor services that people can count on. Whether it’s moving, towing, junk removal, or window installation, we bring precision, pride, and real muscle to every job.</p>

    <p>We’re not just a crew—we’re a team of hands-on problem solvers who believe in fairness, teamwork, and showing up with integrity. Our business model is lean, our work ethic is strong, and our results speak for themselves.</p>

    <p>From day one, we’ve focused on building trust with our clients and delivering value without the fluff. We don’t just move things—we move people forward.</p>
